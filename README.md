<h1>Kanban Task Manager</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is my Kanban task board, using SQL to store columns and tasks, it can be used as a way of visualising tasks within a project, typically 'To do', 'In Progress' and 'Done' but any headings can be used.</p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>To use this webapp run the main.py file and open the localhost, the buttons can be used to add new columns and task, the arrows to move the tasks between columns and the bin to delete tasks or columns, deleting a column with tasks in it will also delete all tasks.</p>
